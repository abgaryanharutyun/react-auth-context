`react-auth-context` is a library that provides a way to manage authentication state in a React application. It is implemented using the React context API, which allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

To use `react-auth-context`, you will need to wrap your root component with an AuthProvider component, which provides the authentication state and methods for updating it as props to its children. You can then use the useAuth hook to access the authentication state and methods from within any descendant component.

For example:

```javascript
import { AuthProvider, useAuth } from "react-auth-context";

function App() {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      <MyComponent />
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}

function MyComponent() {
  const { isAuthenticated, login, logout } = useAuth();

  return (
    <div>
      {isAuthenticated ? (
        <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={login}>Login</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the AuthProvider component provides the isAuthenticated, login, and logout values as context to the MyComponent component, which can then use them to render a login or logout button depending on the authentication state.
